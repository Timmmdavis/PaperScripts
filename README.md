# Paper scripts


## Use scripts in combination with CutAndDisplace to reproduce diagrams from my papers. 

I will try and keep this up to date but some scripts may become outdated. 

Script 1:
DoubleVoid_StressConcentrations.m

Reproduce points along the curve from Figure 12 and 13 of:

[Stress concentrations around voids in three dimensions: The roots of failure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191814117301542),

Script 2:

FractureFrictionFaceSlip.m

Reproduce figure 4 slip profile from:

[2018: Slip on wavy frictional faults: Is the 3rd dimension a sticking point?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191814118301597),
